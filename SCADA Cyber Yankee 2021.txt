SCADA Cyber Yankee 2021.txt

Distributed control system - DCS - contained into one plant
SCADA - Supervisory COntrol and Data aqcuisitions - for remote operations on pipelines, water systems, upstream gas/liquid operations
Programmable Logic Controller - bases systems for smaller plants and facilities
RTU - Remote Terminal Unit - like PLCs

Unexpected comms to ICS or OT can cripple it
Problem with SCADA is that the systems are usually only hardened to a specific extent and then barely updated/patched.

Programming PLCs
	OG design to replace massive wiring closets for legacy systems

Water Systems
Very little in regards to CYberSec
EPA And local level of authority
First CyberSec regulations was passed in 2018.
System are going to be wide spread
Critical dependence on electrical

Electric
	Regulated by NERC North American Electric Reliability Corp
	BES - Bulk Electric System

Critical Mission Operations:
	Maintain operations - black start is rough


SCADA in PCTE
Easy to rebuild and restart
First gen system, designed to be logical
	no values of amperages and volts
	On and off 
	ModBus of TCP
Three different components
HMI, Historian, and ICS Proxys

Windows Program - HMI - shows ICS for each orange team
Green is good, red is off

ICS components proxy
	currently windows - TCP 502 

Historian - offlimits for range
ModBus protocol is controlling devices
